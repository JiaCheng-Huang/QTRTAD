this is a gem as a film four production the anticipated quality was indeed delivered shot with great style that reminded me some errol morris films well arranged and simply gripping it's long yet horrifying to the point it's excruciating we know something bad happened one can guess by the lack of participation of a person in the interviews but we are compelled to see it a bit like a car accident in slow motion the story spans most conceivable aspects and unlike some documentaries did not try and refrain from showing the grimmer sides of the stories as also dealing with the guilt of the people don left behind him wondering why they didn't stop him in time it took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that gripped me after seeing this very well made documentary UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK	this is a gem as a film four production the anticipated quality was indeed delivered shot with great style that reminded me some errol morris films well arranged and simply gripping it's long yet horrifying to the point it's excruciating we know something bad happened one can guess by the lack of participation of a person in the interviews but we are compelled to see it a bit like a car accident in slow motion the story spans most conceivable aspects and unlike some documentaries did not try and refrain from showing the grimmer sides of the stories as also dealing with the guilt of the people don left behind him wondering why they didn't stop him in time it took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that gripped me after seeing this very well made documentary UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK	1

i'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur i've seen only 4 films so far and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions not a single non lonely female character out of 12 and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings this film is probably the only one out of four where this impact is for good the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for films so it doesn't grab the accent although the looks of the characters might watch for the feelings not for their objects very nice and fleeting truly like a summer romance and while being a relaxation to thought and mind it gives some food for the soul UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK	i'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur i've seen only 4 films so far and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions not a single non lonely female character out of 12 and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings this film is probably the only one out of four where this impact is for good the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for films so it doesn't grab the accent although the looks of the characters might watch for the feelings not for their objects very nice and fleeting truly like a summer romance and while being a relaxation to thought and mind it gives some food for the soul UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK	1
