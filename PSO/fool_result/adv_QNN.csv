tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i've seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father's home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she's prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you've seen it's a	tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films boring seen recently in the end there topic no luchino supernatural element despite what one topic led to jockey throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon heartbroken to their father's home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to add with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who dukakis out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them taunts flounders a special dinner at another time but some salvador as yet unexplained it circa later revealed that the younger sister is dead and cereal only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was systematically enough to theatres her die much about the specifics of the wasting family purpose not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of mischievous definitely not light viewing stole this one when you really want to think about what you've seen it's a	1

okay let me start off by saying that on the whole i don't like anime very much i've enjoyed a couple of the oft cited classic series but regard the medium as a whole in exactly the same way that i do american television namely that a good 90 95 of it is utter tripe with the remainder falling anywhere from watchable to decent this being the case it's no wonder that i don't like the self deprecating anime parodies out there i don't get most of the jokes and the medium itself enforces a certain style of humor that doesn't appeal to me at all loud hyperactive lowbrow and completely over the top so when i started watching this series at the behest of a friend i was primed for disappointment after the first couple of episodes i figured that the characters were supposed to represent cliché characters from shopworn story outlines and that their actions were supposed to be similarly satirical i could kind of see where it was coming from but didn't think that it was all that clever lots of wacky fun filled high school shenanigans and goings on only now we're being ironic about it	okay let me start off by saying that on the whole i don't like anime very much i've enjoyed a couple of the oft cited classic series but regard the medium as a whole in exactly the same way that i do american television namely that a good 90 95 of it is utter tripe with the remainder falling anywhere from watchable to decent this being the case it's no wonder that i don't like the self deprecating anime parodies out there i don't get most of the jokes and the medium itself enforces a certain style of humor that doesn't appeal to me at all loud hyperactive lowbrow and completely over the top so when i started watching this series at the behest of a friend i was primed for disappointment after the first couple of episodes i figured that the characters were supposed to represent cliché characters from shopworn story outlines and that their actions were supposed to be similarly satirical i could kind of see where it was coming from but didn't think that it was all that clever lots of wacky fun filled high school shenanigans and goings on only now we're being ironic about it	1

the beguiled was one of the few early eastwood films i hadn't seen until i gave the dvd a spin today and from it's opening sepia tinged shot to the macabre climax i was utterly enthralled too many film makers these days substitute special effects fast editing and dizzying camera work in place of character driven stories but director don siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot and the characters are believable and compelling the story concerns a ladies finishing school which happens to be situated on the edge of various skirmishes during the american civil war the south supporting ladies find a badly wounded union soldier clint eastwood nursing him back to health he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women for his own ends geraldine page is excellent in the role of the headmistress with a secret and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed for a film that virtually takes place in a single location it never loses visual interest there's even a chance that the normal status quo long abandoned when eastwood's machinations are uncovered could return but the mistresses and pupils descend upon a darker road this is a	the beguiled was one of the few early eastwood films i hadn't seen until i gave the dvd a spin today and from it's opening sepia tinged shot to the macabre climax i was utterly enthralled too many film makers these days substitute special effects fast editing and dizzying camera work in place of character driven stories but director don siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot and the characters are believable and compelling the story concerns a ladies finishing school which happens to be situated on the edge of various skirmishes during the american civil war the south supporting ladies find a badly wounded union soldier clint eastwood nursing him back to health he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women for his own ends geraldine page is excellent in the role of the headmistress with a secret and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed for a film that virtually takes place in a single location it never loses visual interest there's even a chance that the normal status quo long abandoned when eastwood's machinations are uncovered could return but the mistresses and pupils descend upon a darker road this is a	1
ok so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid however i think there can never be too many movies like the first karate kid there's something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me you get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself in this movie hillary swank is a particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her not to say this movie is not without it's problems unlike the first one mr miyagi appears to be a little to eager to get julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie also one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks the movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life and doesn't really explain why they do what they do in the plot line the villains are also a bit questionable even though truly hateable bad guys i also have a suspicion about martial arts	ok so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid however i think there can never be too many movies like the first karate kid there's something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me you get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself in this movie hillary swank is a particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her not to say this movie is not without it's problems unlike the first one mr miyagi appears to be a little to eager to get julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie also one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks the movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life and doesn't really explain why they do what they do in the plot line the villains are also a bit questionable even though truly hateable bad guys i also have a suspicion about martial arts	1
