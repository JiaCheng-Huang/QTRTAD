tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i've seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father's home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she's prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you've seen it's a	tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i've seen recently in the end there is no laughably supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father's home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she's prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you've seen it's a	1

okay let me start off by saying that on the whole i don't like anime very much i've enjoyed a couple of the oft cited classic series but regard the medium as a whole in exactly the same way that i do american television namely that a good 90 95 of it is utter tripe with the remainder falling anywhere from watchable to decent this being the case it's no wonder that i don't like the self deprecating anime parodies out there i don't get most of the jokes and the medium itself enforces a certain style of humor that doesn't appeal to me at all loud hyperactive lowbrow and completely over the top so when i started watching this series at the behest of a friend i was primed for disappointment after the first couple of episodes i figured that the characters were supposed to represent cliché characters from shopworn story outlines and that their actions were supposed to be similarly satirical i could kind of see where it was coming from but didn't think that it was all that clever lots of wacky fun filled high school shenanigans and goings on only now we're being ironic about it	okay let me start off by saying that on the whole i don't like anime very much i've enjoyed a couple of the oft cited classic series but regard the medium as a whole in exactly the same way that i do american television namely that a good 90 95 of it is utter tripe with the remainder falling anywhere from watchable to decent this being the case it's no wonder that i don't like the self deprecating anime parodies out there i don't get most of the jokes and the medium itself enforces a certain style of humor that doesn't appeal to me at all loud hyperactive lowbrow and completely over the top so when i started watching this series at the behest of a friend i was primed for disappointment after the first couple of episodes i figured that the characters were supposed to represent cliché characters from shopworn story outlines and that their actions were supposed to be similarly satirical i could kind of see where it was coming from but didn't think that it was all that clever lots of wacky fun filled high school shenanigans and goings on only now we're being ironic about it	1
this is not a serious film and does not pretend to be but it is not as bad as some of its reviews it's title and the first ten minutes lead you to expect the plot is very silly but this adds to the light hearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film the characters are played sympathetically and while they do engage in typical teenage angst they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre unusually set in london sympathetic to geeks this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on if you want some tongue in cheek silliness and don't mind suspending your disbelief UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK	this is not a serious film and does not pretend to be but it is not as bad as some of its reviews it's title and the first ten minutes lead you to expect the plot is very silly but this adds to the light hearted pyare and enthusiasm which runs through the film the characters are played sympathetically and while they do engage in typical teenage angst they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre unusually set in london sympathetic to geeks this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on if you want some tongue in cheek silliness and don't mind suspending your disbelief UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK	1

i honestly have to say that a cat in the brain is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films i've ever seen this film is packed with stupid dialog ridiculous scenes and a self involving plot starring legendary horror director lucio fulci himself the threadbare story line is about an aging director fulci who is also named lucio fulci in the film who is starting to go nuts and because of all the vicious things he's put down in film over the past many years he goes to a shrink who hypnotizes fulci and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing the rest of the film is made up of shots from the film that fulci is directing during all this action scenes of the shrink killing people all the while grinning like a f cking moron and some of fulci's hallucination sequences oh and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well a cat in the brain is completely over top and ridiculous in every sense the gore is classic fulci nasty and strong with some really decent scenes	i honestly have to say that a cat in the brain is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films i've ever seen this film is packed with stupid dialog ridiculous scenes and a self involving plot starring legendary horror director lucio fulci himself the threadbare story line is about an aging director fulci who is also named lucio fulci in the film who is starting to go nuts and because of all the vicious things he's put down in film over the past many years he goes to a shrink who hypnotizes fulci and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing the rest of the film is made up of shots from the film that fulci is directing during all this action scenes of the shrink killing people all the while grinning like a f cking moron and some of fulci's hallucination sequences oh and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well a cat in the brain is completely over top and ridiculous in every sense the gore is classic fulci nasty and strong with some really decent scenes	1

so after years and years i finally track this film down i was dying to see how it lived up to my memories i distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine then waiting behind two planks of wood crossed in the just staring out with a pale white face this single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood i remember chills running down my spine watching it now its obviously nowhere near as scary but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again if anyone wants a copy private message me the story itself is fairly standard stuff its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around there is no real moral as such except that are here to help us ' or 'don't be prejudiced against ghosts ' there wasn't even a greed capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine however a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain encouraging the two kids to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only into a mine but into a new mine hole which is totally dangerous the captain then encourages the children	so after years and years i finally track this film down i was dying to see how it lived up to my memories i distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine then waiting behind two planks of wood crossed in the just staring out with a pale white face this single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood i remember chills running down my spine watching it now its obviously nowhere near as scary but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again if anyone wants a copy private message me the story itself is fairly standard stuff its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around there is no real moral as such except that are here to help us ' or 'don't be prejudiced against ghosts ' there wasn't even a greed capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine however a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain encouraging the two kids to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only into a mine but into a new mine hole which is totally dangerous the captain then encourages the children	1

take a subject i didn't know much about and make it exciting why don't you it so happens that back about 1979 director robert altman said that he didn't believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding skateboards if he doesn't break his neck will make the first movie well i wouldn't put such an expectation on stacy peralta but he is a who has made a good movie of course he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed peralta edited it together well with not your usual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today the whole effect is post modern in the best sense but that has been done altman's prediction hasn't quite come true what peralta has done however is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the z boys this is all good i highly recommend dogtown UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK	take a subject i didn't know much about and make it exciting why don't you it so happens that back about 1979 director robert altman said that he didn't believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding skateboards if he doesn't break his neck will make the first movie well i wouldn't put such an expectation on stacy peralta but he is a who has made a good movie of course he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed peralta edited it together well with not your usual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today the whole effect is post modern in the best sense pathetic that has been done altman's prediction hasn't quite come irrational what peralta has done however is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the z boys this is all good i highly recommend dogtown UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK	1

i write this review just after hearing of stanley kubrick's death it's a great loss and i write about 2001 a space odyssey because i feel it is the consummate kubrick film the one he will be most remembered for it is a picture like no other not only science fiction but changing the way films are it was probably america's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of george lucas and countless other writers and directors aside from its visual greatness the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it kubrick and arthur c clarke his co writer had a vision but we have never really found out what was going through their minds of course the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful 2001's ending is one of hope a version of our rebirth through the star child's flight back to earth it is meaningless to many but discerning filmgoers will understand although 2001 does not have the wicked dark humor of dr strangelove or clockwork	i write this review just after hearing of stanley kubrick's death it's a great loss and i write about 2001 a space odyssey because i feel it is the consummate chicanery film the one he will be most remembered for it is a picture like no other not only science fiction but changing the way films are it was probably america's first 'art' film and has anticlimactic the likes of george lucas and countless other writers and directors aside from its visual greatness the reason the film spawns so much recycled and analysis is because so snidely people have so many different interpretations of it kubrick and arthur c clarke his co writer had a vision but we have never really found out what was going through their minds of course the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our disgrace unless we are careful 2001's ending is one of hope a version of our rebirth through the star child's flight back to earth it is meaningless to many but discerning filmgoers will understand although 2001 does not have the wicked dark criminally of dr strangelove or clockwork	1
it is interesting to see what people think of this movie since it is in fact quite unique though it bears some of the trademarks of clive barker's writing even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that need standard hollywood plot hooks and layered so that if you expect to be fed you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot those who need a linear specific and plot line will hate this movie because the story lies like in the novella partially between the lines or in this case partially off screen in comments and the imagination another possible hang up is the ending of which i can say without spoiling it that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad it is in fact not very defined at all which i know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didn't get to know what happened but to me and to many others i'm sure just adds another dimension to the story the dimension of speculation and in addition the point that great disruption has a tendency	it is interesting to see what people think of this movie since it is in fact quite unique though it bears some of the trademarks of clive barker's writing even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that need standard hollywood plot hooks and layered so that if you expect to be fed you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot those who need a linear specific and plot line will hate this movie because the story lies like in the novella partially between the lines or in this case partially off screen in comments and the imagination another possible hang up is the ending of which i can say without spoiling it that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad it is in fact not very defined at all which i know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didn't get to know what happened but to me and to many others i'm sure just adds another dimension to the story the dimension of speculation and in addition the point that great disruption has a tendency	1

this production of hamlet prince of denmark is by far the best that i have seen although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations it does have the most important element sir derek jacobi as hamlet jacobi's portrayal of the disturbed prince is multi layered and riveting his displays of emotion swing from hatred to sorrow love to and everywhere else on the map but without seeming forced or over the top in fact some of the more powerful sequences occur when he underplays them with stillness soft speech and thoughtful expression as to whether or not he interprets hamlet as mad or sane well you should decide for yourselves i changed my mind more than once at one point it seems he has thought himself sane and merely playing at madness but suspects that he is actually mad after all a revelation to himself captured beautifully having performed the part of hamlet on stage more times than any other actor in history jacobi's affinity for the role then comes as little surprise as for the production itself it is presented as a kind of filmed copy of the stage play with little	this production of hamlet ghastly of denmark is by far the completely that i have seen although it may not have the production value of some of the more surplus adaptations it does have the most important element sir derek jacobi as hamlet jacobi's portrayal of the disturbed prince is multi layered and riveting his displays of emotion swing from tuneless to exam love to and everywhere else on the map but without seeming forced or over the top in fact some of the more powerful sequences occur when he underplays them with stillness soft speech and thoughtful expression as to whether or not he interprets hamlet as mad or sane well you scared decide for yourselves i changed my mind more than once at one point it seems he has thought himself sane and merely playing at madness but suspects that he is actually mad after all a revelation to himself captured beautifully having performed the part of hamlet on stage more times contrived any other actor in history jacobi's affinity for the role then comes as little surprise as for the production itself it is presented as a kind of filmed copy of the stage play with little	1
