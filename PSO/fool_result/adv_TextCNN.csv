tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i've seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father's home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she's prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you've seen it's a	tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i've seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father's home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she's prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family machines not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you've seen it's a	1

okay let me start off by saying that on the whole i don't like anime very much i've enjoyed a couple of the oft cited classic series but regard the medium as a whole in exactly the same way that i do american television namely that a good 90 95 of it is utter tripe with the remainder falling anywhere from watchable to decent this being the case it's no wonder that i don't like the self deprecating anime parodies out there i don't get most of the jokes and the medium itself enforces a certain style of humor that doesn't appeal to me at all loud hyperactive lowbrow and completely over the top so when i started watching this series at the behest of a friend i was primed for disappointment after the first couple of episodes i figured that the characters were supposed to represent cliché characters from shopworn story outlines and that their actions were supposed to be similarly satirical i could kind of see where it was coming from but didn't think that it was all that clever lots of wacky fun filled high school shenanigans and goings on only now we're being ironic about it	okay let me start off by saying that on the whole i don't like anime very much i've enjoyed a couple of the oft cited classic series but regard the medium as a whole in exactly the same way that i do american television namely that a good 90 95 of it is utter tripe with the remainder falling anywhere from watchable to decent this being the case it's no wonder that i don't like the self deprecating anime parodies out there i don't get most of the jokes and the medium itself enforces a certain style of humor that doesn't appeal to me at all loud hyperactive lowbrow and completely over the top so when i started watching this series at the behest of a friend i was primed for disappointment after the first couple of episodes i figured that the characters were supposed to represent cliché characters from shopworn story outlines and that their actions were supposed to be similarly satirical i could kind of see where it was coming from but didn't think that it was all that clever lots of wacky fun filled high school shenanigans and goings on only now we're being ironic about it	1
this is not a serious film and does not pretend to be but it is not as bad as some of its reviews it's title and the first ten minutes lead you to expect the plot is very silly but this adds to the light hearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film the characters are played sympathetically and while they do engage in typical teenage angst they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre unusually set in london sympathetic to geeks this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on if you want some tongue in cheek silliness and don't mind suspending your disbelief UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK	this is not a serious film and does not pretend to be but it is not as bad as some of its reviews it's title and the first ten minutes lead you to expect the plot is very silly but this adds to the light hearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film the characters are played sympathetically and while they do engage in typical teenage angst they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre unusually set in london sympathetic to geeks this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on if you want some tongue in cheek silliness and don't mind suspending your disbelief UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK	1

this little short absolutely fascinates me the only thing i've seen thus far like it is some of the work by sam the creator of dog star man however where is trying to unnerve by making us learn how to see again and provide us with an affront of head ache inducing bright colors and flashes which i still totally dig and embrace as high art this film i would characterize as very relaxing and hypnotizing man ray's general use of spinning objects camera does not create so much of a dizzy feeling but a warm flow of senses intermingling and going along with the gravity of the moving world around us an interesting conceit of this very short work is that as it goes along objects become more and more recognizable until we end on a nude torso of which i feel is the least feminine well rounded breasts i've ever seen the circles and spirals of shadow and light over the torso make it an object of surrealistic beauty something that you could hang on your wall and delve over forever it's because of this and other images in this film that i had to watch it again	this little short absolutely fascinates me the only thing i've rash thus far like it is some of the work by sam the creator of dog star man however where is trying to unnerve by making us learn how to see again and provide us with an affront of head ache inducing bright inventory and flashes which i still totally dig and embrace as high art this film i would characterize as very relaxing and hypnotizing man ray's general use of spinning objects camera does not create so much of a dizzy feeling but a warm flow of senses intermingling and going along with the gravity of the moving world around us an interesting conceit of this very short work is that as it absurd along objects become more and more recognizable until we end on a nude torso of which i feel is the least feminine well rounded breasts i've ever seen the circles and spirals of shadow and light over the torso make it an object of surrealistic beauty something that you could hang on your wall and delve over forever it's because of this and other images in this film that i had to watch it again	1
